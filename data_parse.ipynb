Given that the Inter  net is so large and has so many diverse components and uses, is there any hope of understanding how it works? Are there guiding principles and structure that can provide a foundation for understanding such an amazingly large and complex sys  tem? And if so, is it possible that it actually could be both interesting and fun to  learn about computer networks? Fortunately, the answer to all of these questions is a resounding YES! Indeed, it’s our aim in this book to provide you with a modern introduction to the dynamic field of computer networking, giving you the princi  ples and practical insights you’ll need to understand not only today’s networks, but tomorrow’s as well. This first chapter presents a broad overview of computer networking and the  Internet. Our goal here is to paint a broad picture and set the context for the rest of this book, to see the forest through the trees. We’ll cover a lot of ground in this introductory chapter and discuss a lot of the pieces of a computer network, without losing sight of the big picture. We’ll structure our overview of computer networks in this chapter as follows.  After introducing some basic terminology and concepts, we’ll first examine the basic hardware and software components that make up a network. We’ll begin at the network’s edge and look at the end systems and network applications running in the network. We’ll then explore the core of a computer network, examining the links 1CHAPTER Computer  Networks and the Internet'}"]},"execution_count":311,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["json_data[0]"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### For BM25 retrieval"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":310,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["with open(\"./resources/document_page_filtered.json\", \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n","    json.dump(json_data, f, indent=\"\\t\")"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### For Dense passage retrieval"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import json\n","\n","with open(\"./resources/document_page_filtered.json\", \"r\") as f:\n","    json_filtered = json.load(f)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import copy\n","\n","json_dpr = copy.deepcopy(json_filtered)\n","\n","with open(\"./resources/document_dpr.json\", \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n","    for json_dict in json_dpr:\n","        del json_dict[\"page\"]\n","        json_dict[\"contents\"] += \"\\n\"\n","        json.dump(json_dict, f)\n","        f.write(\"\\n\")\n","        "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### DPR with summarization"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import json\n","\n","with open(\"./resources/document_summary.json\", \"r\") as f:\n","    json_dpr_summary = json.load(f)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":316,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import copy\n","\n","json_dpr = copy.deepcopy(json_dpr_summary)\n","\n","with open(\"./resources/document_dpr_summary.json\", \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n","    for json_dict in json_dpr:\n","        del json_dict[\"page\"]\n","        json_dict[\"contents\"] += \"\\n\"\n","        json.dump(json_dict, f)\n","        f.write(\"\\n\")\n","        "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMRFYuLGYhc/9zxdvy/q37y","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.16"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
